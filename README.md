# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

#Overview of the analysis
The overview of this analysis was to create lists that provided information on the number of employees that would be retiring and what employees would be eligible for the mentorship program.

#Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
-The data that was shown in the retirement_titles.csv, showed a lot of doubles due to majority of the retirees receiving promotions throughout their time at Pewlett-Hackard. So another analysis had to be done and that is where the information from the unique_titles came from.
-Based on the unique_titles.csv, there are more than 70,000 employees that will be retiring over the next couple of years.
-Most of the employees retiring held hire up positions, such as "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff" based on the data from the retiring_titles.csv.
-According to the mentorship_eligibility.csv, 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program.

#Summary
  How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  -There will be a little over 1500 roles that will be vacant once the "silver tsunami" begins to take effect.
  Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  -I believe there are nmore than enough qualified retirement ready employees who can take on mentoring before they retire. The first wave of will only be about 1500 employees. That number will increase as the years go on but there is definitely enough time as well as enough employees to have a successful mentorship program for the next generation of employees.
